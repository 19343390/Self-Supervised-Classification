### Self-Supervised Sample Data

The data in this folder have two purposes:
1) in the 'Train' Folder, there are samples of images/classification pairs for training (with representative filenames)
    - The Train folder should only be used as an example
2) the `sample_model.h5` and `class.csv` are a fully trained model from the data repository dataset (add link to Durham data repository)
    - The sample_model.h5 can be loaded directly into `SelfSupervisedClassification.py`
